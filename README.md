Tip Calculator. Please read readme.md for more details

We're going to be building a tip calculator. So the final output is going to look like this.

It's going to print

Welcome to the tip calculator.

And it's going to ask you for an input for how much the total bill came to.

Let's say that we and a couple of friends went out for lunch and it came to 124.56 dollars.

And then it'll ask, what percentage tip would you like to give?

So let's say we want to give a 12 percent tip.

So we enter 12 and hit enter.

And then finally it asks how many people are splitting this bill?

Let's say there's seven of us and then hit enter.

Finally, it's going to tell us that each person should pay about $19.93.

Notice how the final bill, even though after all of these calculations, it's probably got more numbers after the decimal point, we only want two decimal places of accuracy, so it should be rounded to twodecimal places.
